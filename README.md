# Insurance-Fraud-Prediction : I found this project in Kaggle and recreated it to learn various ensemble models and classification metrics.
- Challenges faced :
  
  • Presence of junk characters, nulls etc and outliers which needed feature engineering and outlier treatment. 

  • Encoding of categorical columns.

- Tools / techniques used :
  
  • Google colab along with pandas, numpy, Sci Kit learn, visualization libraries etc. 

  • Techniques include preprocessing, feature transformation, outlier detection and treatment, study of visualization graphs, model evaluations and hyper parameter 
  tuning. 
  
  • Model selection based on confusion matrix scores and test accuracy scores. 

- Model Selection :
  
  • Several models were compared on the basis of accuracy scores (e.g. SVC, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ada Boost, XG Boost, Cat Boost etc) 

  • Best numbers were returned by the ensemble boosting classifier models Ada Boost and XG Boost. 

- Project outcome :
  
  • Predict the possibility of fraudulent insurance claim on the basis of policy details and insurance claim details.
